      <h3>Personal</h3>
      
      <p>I was born and raised in the suburbs of Seattle, WA. I completed my undergraduate studies (Bachelor of Arts) at the University of Washington</p>
      
      <p>My husband Brian and I recently purchased our first home, actually his parents house and are in the midst of many <s>exciting</s> expensive home improvement projects. We are owned by two cats, <a href="../week1/semantic_tags/index.html">Cooper</a> and Jada. I can't even imagine how boring my life would be without them around to entertain me.  </p>
      
      <h4>Husky Football</h4>
      
      <p>Brian and I are such big Husky football fans that we actually met almost 10 years ago on a Husky message board. Between the two of us, we have held season tickets for over 15 years. We try to travel to multiple away games each year</p>
